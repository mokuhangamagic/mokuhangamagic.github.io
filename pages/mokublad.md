### Mokublad selected work

A few months ago we launched an open call for contemporary mokuhanga artists, and we received submissions from all over the world!  
The selected works will be published in a small newspaper, __Mokublad__. This format allows us to reach a wide audience and to refer to the original, accessible and commercial nature of Japanese woodblock printmaking. It is part of our Kamishibai project, where we are cycling around Flanders with a travelling exhibition and mokuhanga demonstrations.

We are proud to present you the selected artworks for __Mokublad__:

    bio="lives and works in Belgium. While studying printmaking, he developed a love for woodcut, which has continued to run like a thread through his artistic practice ever since. To master Japanese woodcut, Vladimir apprenticed with Paul Furneaux and in 2007 participated in the Nagasawa Art Park Project in Japan, the forerunner of the current Mi- Lab. Since 2011, Vladimir has been teaching mokuhanga at the Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent. There he met Soetkin Everaert. In 2022 Vladimir and Soetkin have the opportunity to curate this project on mokuhanga in cooperation with Focus Vakmanschap."
