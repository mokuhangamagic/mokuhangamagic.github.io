Mokuhanga Magic! is a project by [Vladimir Ivaneanu](https://www.printstudio868.be){:target="_blank"} and [Soetkin Everaert](https://www.soetkineveraert.be){:target="_blank"}.  
We are two artists with a shared passion for the technique of Japanese woodcut.

__Vladimir__ is a printmaking artist specialising in relief printing and Japanese woodcut. He went to Japan in 2007 to learn the tricks of the trade.

__Soetkin__ has a background as a sculptor and draughtsman. She was a student of Vladimir at the Academy of Ghent.

In 2024, Vladimir and Soetkin will travel to Japan together to work with Japanese masters to see how they can better use craftsmanship, evaluate their own practice and reflect on the future.

#### Master / apprentice

Since January 2023, we have been participating in an master-apprentice program. 

This scholarship is awarded by the Flemish community and supports passing on craftsmanship.
For two years, Vladimir will pass on his know-how of the technique of woodcutting and printmaking to Soetkin.

We will also explore together the possibilities that Japanese woodcut can offer in the European printmaking landscape as an accessible, innovative and ecological technique. We will both apply that knowledge in our own artistic work. We hope to share our passion and knowledge with as many interested parties as possible and spread the magic of this fantastic technique.
