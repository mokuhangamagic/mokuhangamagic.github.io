### Travelling exposition 2024 info

<div class="pt-3" markdown="1">
From __November 2023 to Januari 2025__, we travel around with a mobile exhibition '__Weg van de Japanse houtsnede__' on Japanese woodcut throughout several Flemish cities. The exhibition consists of 3 parts:
1. the exhibition itself
2. accompanying publication
3. a live demonstration at the exhibition venue

In the exhibition, we provide both a brief historical overview and a visual insight into the different steps of the printing process of a Japanese woodcut by means of working materials, wood plates, prints and a documentary film.

  The exhibition concept is based on the idea of a __kamishibai__: a mobile Japanese theatre. All exhibition components are collected in a specially tailored cabinet (by [Atelier OH](https://www.atelieroh.com/about/){:target="_blank"} and [Goshia Olchowska](https://www.malgorzatamariaolchowska.com){:target="_blank"}) that can be moved from one location to another by bicycle.  
  This cabinet can house all materials such as the paper, wood blocks, paint and tools we need to give a mokuhanga demonstration for the exhibition audience (check the demo dates).      
  It will also be equipped with an iPad so that visitors who could not attend a demonstration can still get an insight into each step of the printing process via a documentary film.

Besides the historical and educational aspect of the exhibition, the second part, the accompanying publication, will introduce visitors to the fascinating and diverse world of contemporary mokuhanga through the works of artists from all over the world who each work with this special medium in their own unique way.

We launched an __Open Call__ and this brought us entries from all over the world! The selected works are published in a small catalogue, the __Publication Mokublad__. 
[Click here for a free download.](/assets/pdf/mokuhangamagic-mokublad.pdf){:target="_blank"}

The publication will be distributed in all Flemish museums and cultural centres. All this was made possible with the support of [Focus Vakmanschap](https://immaterieelerfgoed.be/nl/nieuws/focusvakmanschap2021-2023){:target="_blank"}.

The MOKUBLAD is a kind of newspaper, created in collaboration with [TUIG](https://www.tuig.rocks){:target="_blank"}. We specifically choose this format because it allows us to reach a wide audience and make a reference to the original, approachable and commercial character of Japanese woodcut.
