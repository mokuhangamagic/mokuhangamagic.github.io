From November 2023 to January 2025 we will be travelling around several Flemish cities with a mobile exhibition on Japanese woodblock prints. 

The exhibition 'Weg van de Japanse houtsnede' consists of 2 parts, the exhibition itself and the accompanying publication. In the exhibition we give both a short historical overview and a visual insight into the different steps of the printing process of a Japanese woodblock print by means of working materials, woodblocks, prints and a documentary film.
