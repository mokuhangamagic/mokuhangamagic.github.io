Mara Cozzolino lives and works in Italy. She has been drawing since childhood and later experimented mainly with etching techniques, such as aquatint in different colors. 

After a trip to Japan and since participating in an artist residency at the Mi-Lab, Mokuhanga Innovation Laboratory, in Kawaguchiko, she works exclusively with Japanese woodcuts. Like April Vollmer, she is a board member of the IMA, the International Mokuhanga Association, helping to further, international spread of Japanese woodcut. Mara regularly exhibits her work in Italy and abroad.
