Aagje Vanoverbeke lives and works in Belgium. In addition to her training as an interior architect, she took classes in drawing, painting and sculpture. 

In recent years she has focused mainly on graphics in which she developed a great interest in Japanese woodcut. 

In the almost ritualistic and enduring nature of the mokuhanga, Aagje finds the perfect materialization of the sense of stillness she experiences and seeks when observing a landscape.
