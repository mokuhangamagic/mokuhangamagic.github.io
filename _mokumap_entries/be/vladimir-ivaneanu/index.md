Vladimir Invaneau lives and works in Belgium. He's the founding father of Mokuhanga Magic.

While studying printmaking, he developed a love for woodcut, which has continued to run like a thread through his artistic practice ever since. 

To master Japanese woodcut, Vladimir apprenticed with Paul Furneaux and in 2007 participated in the Nagasawa Art Park Project in Japan, the forerunner of the current Mi- Lab. 

Since 2011, Vladimir has been teaching mokuhanga at the Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent. There he met Soetkin Everaert. 

In 2022 Vladimir and Soetkin have the opportunity to curate this project on mokuhanga in cooperation with Focus Vakmanschap.
