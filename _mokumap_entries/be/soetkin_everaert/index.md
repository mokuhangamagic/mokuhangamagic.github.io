Soetkin Everaert lives and works in Belgium and is the founding mother of Mokuhanga Magic.

Soetkin studied sculpture at LUCA Brussels. After her studies, she specialized in other disciplines such as ceramics and textile arts. 

In 2018, she started the art course in free graphics at the Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent to study Japanese woodcut with Vladimir Ivaneanu.

In her artistic work, Soetkin seeks to hold the ephemeral and temporary of “being” and turn it into stillness. 

In 2022, Soetkin and Vladimir have the opportunity to curate this project on mokuhanga in cooperation with Focus Vakmanschap.
