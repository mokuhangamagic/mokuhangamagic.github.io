Adelina Iantcheva grew up in Bulgaria, but has been living and working in Belgium for almost thirty years. H

er artistic adventure really began after she moved to Belgium. Thanks to part-time art education, she immersed herself first in the world of fashion and then in that of painting. 

Since 2017, she has been completely captivated by the endless possibilities of graphics. Adelina repeatedly researches with great enthusiasm and passion the printing techniques she is offered, including mokuhanga. She consciously looks for the limits and the (im)possibilities that a technique can offer her.
