Cameron Bailey lives and works in the United States. He studied painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and came into contact with printmaking beginning in 2016. Since then, he specialized in water-carried woodcut, such as Japanese woodcut. Cameron uses traditional Japanese tools and materials to create atmospheric landscapes and portraits using the reduction method. All colors are printed from a single wood plate, a new piece is cut away each time per printing to arrive at the final image. Cameron exhibits his work both inside and outside America.
