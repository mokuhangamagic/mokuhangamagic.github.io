Benjamin Selby lives and works in the United States. In recent years, Benjaminâ€™s graphic work has focused on mastering Japanese woodcuts. 

To this end, he took classes with Richard Steiner at the Kyoto International Mokuhanga School in 2018 and a residency with Terry McKenna at the Karuizawa Mokuhanga School in 2023. 

Benjamin uses his experiences fishing for catfish, caymans and carp in a treacherous stretch of the Trinity River in Texas as a starting point for his works. In addition to traditional cutting techniques, Benjamin also uses new technology such as laser cutting.
