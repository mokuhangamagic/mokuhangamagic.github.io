Axel Næss lives and studies in Norway. 

Axel studies East Asian art forms and their development throughout history. In addition to his theoretical studies, Axel also ventures into creating his own artistic work. During his stay at the Taiwan National University of Arts, in the spring of 2023, thanks to a Japanese master he came into contact with the Japanese woodcut. 
Since then, Axel has been diligently experimenting with the possibilities of this fascinating medium and exploring what mokuhanga can do for him within his artistic work.
