Eva Pietzcker lives and works in Germany. After her art education, Eva focused on creating work in various printmaking techniques such as dry needle, silkscreen and woodcut. 

In 2003, she traveled to Japan to participate in the Nagasawa Art Park Project, the forerunner of todayâ€™s Mi-Lab, Mokuhanga Innovation Lab. Since then, mokuhanga has been her medium of choice to shape her simple yet complex landscapes and still lifes. 

In Berlin, Eva has her own graphic workshop where she regularly teaches workshops on mokuhanga to an international audience.
